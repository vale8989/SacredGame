About the script:

"Defeat the Evil Magician! Play the game and achive this, by in your way to the castle where the Magician lives, you will need to sort a few obstacles in order to reach the final stage. You will find in the first part of the script the description of the structure of the game."

This was created to practice some functions, loops, define, and other basic coding skills in Python.
Also was though to be fun!
Hope you enjoy it and if there some improvements that could be done, please give me the feedback.
Thanks!
